Hi everyone! My commission status is currently **back open**.

*JUST IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO:*
* Programming (small things)
* GFX
* Texturing

In addition to this post, I'd also like to announce another thing.
I am currently starting a group of my own called **Nazomeita**. It's an ancient Japanese styled MMORPG with many elements you've seen from other games! Should you choose to become a powerful shogun or a spirit seeking vengeance? The choice is yours. Partake adventures worth taking!
